Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes factors influencing student performance in a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on student demographics, academic records, and personal backgrounds. The goal is to identify key determinants of academic success and inform interventions to enhance student outcomes.

Data
The dataset contains information on 2392 students, including:

Demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, parental education)
Academic performance (study time, absences, final grade)
Extracurricular activities (tutoring, parental support, extracurricular participation, sports, music, volunteering)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our analysis revealed several key findings:

GPA Distribution: Student GPA exhibits a right skew, indicating more students achieve higher GPAs. (Visualizations can be added here)
Gender and GPA: The average GPA for male students is slightly higher than for females (1.92 vs. 1.89).
Parental Education and GPA: Students with parents having a "High School" education level have the highest average GPA (1.94). There's a weak negative correlation between higher parental education and GPA. (Visualizations can be added here)
Study Time and GPA: There's a weak positive correlation (0.179) between study time and GPA, suggesting a slight increase in GPA with more study time. (Visualizations can be added here)
Absences and GPA: A strong negative correlation (-0.919) exists between absences and GPA, indicating a significant decrease in GPA with more absences. (Visualizations can be added here)
Study Time Distribution: Student study time tends to cluster around 3-5 hours weekly, with a larger portion dedicating less time and a smaller portion studying significantly longer. (Visualizations can be added here)
Key Insights
Parental education and weekly study time are strong predictors of student success.
Absences have the most significant negative impact on academic performance.
Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend:

Implementing support programs for students with low parental education backgrounds.
Strategies to improve attendance due to its strong negative impact on GPA.
Offering support programs or resources to encourage increased study time, particularly for students dedicating less than 3 hours weekly.
This project is a starting point for further investigation into student performance factors. Future work could involve building predictive models or analyzing additional datasets.
